#Surf Report Overview
The Surf Report API returns hour-by-hour surfing conditions for a specific beach. Surfing conditions include the surf height, wind speed, tide levels, and water temperature. The API also returns a general recommendation for whether to go surf at the specified beach.

Surfers can use this information to plan when and where to surf.

**NOTE:** A list of available beaches is at `http://example.com/surfreport/beaches_available`.

**NOTE:** Surf reports do not include rip tide conditions.
